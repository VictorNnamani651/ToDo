# ToDo
This is a Todo App built with HTML, CSS,  and JavaScript I built this to improve my logic skills. It is also aimed at strengthening JavaScript fundamentals, improving problem-solving skills, and gaining hands-on experience with DOM manipulation and event handling. 
The project is designed as a learning exercise to go beyond static layouts and get hands-on experience with data persistence using the browser's LocalStorage, simulating basic backend/database functionality.
